This is a simple python script that will search the current folder (that the exe exists in) for any .txt files and convert the typical "&G" type color codes from the mud to forum color codes. 

You can download from google docs as a txt file or usually when you're writing in notepad or notepad++ they are already in txt format. Most word editors allow you to convert to this type of file as well.

You also have the option to run the python script itself if you are familiar with python.

The exe is standalone and you do not need to download the .py for it to work.

WARNING: This will permanently overwrite your file. I suggest you save a copy before attempting conversion just in case. You will not get an 'undo' button if anything explodes.

Run the exe and you will get a list of files. Enter the corresponding # to convert.

Hit enter and in about .2 seconds the file will convert all the "&G" color codes to their appropriate forum codes. You will need to delete the first [/color] code.
